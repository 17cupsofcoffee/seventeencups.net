After fiddling with static site generators for about a year and not finding one I liked, I finally bit the bullet and installed [Ghost](https://ghost.org) - I've really been enjoying it so far, mild installation issues aside.

I'll be breaking in this new site in the next couple of days with a F# and Akka.NET tutorial!
