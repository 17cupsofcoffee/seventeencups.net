I've since ditched Ghost and moved to a nice little static site generator called [Gutenberg](http://getgutenberg.io/) - more info on that [here](https://www.seventeencups.net/posts/hello-gutenberg/)!

After fiddling with static site generators for about a year and not finding one I liked, I finally bit the bullet and installed [Ghost](https://ghost.org) - I've really been enjoying it so far, mild installation issues aside.

I'll be breaking in this new site in the next couple of days with a F# and Akka.NET tutorial!
