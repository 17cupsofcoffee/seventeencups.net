## Code
All my code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee) - you can find an up-to-date listing of the projects I'm working on there. Here's a few of them:

### Tetra
<small>[GitHub](https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee/Tetra)</small>

A 2D game development framework for C# and MonoGame, with a heavy focus on ease-of-use and solid documentation.

### Ein
<small>[GitHub](https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee/ein)</small>

A Lua-inspired programming language, which I wrote in order to teach myself more about compilers and parsers - very heavily work in progress!

### Still Hungry
<small>[Website](https://stillhungry.seventeencups.net/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee/Still-Hungry)</small>

A Minecraft mod that adds new foods and cooking mechanics. Features art by [DizzyAlyx](https://dizzyalyx.deviantart.com). Currently unmaintained, but kept online for posterity (it was the first programming project I ever released)!  

## Music
Various pieces of music I've worked on can be found on my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/17cupsofcoffee).
