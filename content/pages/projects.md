## Code
All my code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee) - you can find an up-to-date listing of the projects I'm working on there. Here's a few of them:

### Ein
[<small><i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i> GitHub</small>](https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee/ein)

A Lua-inspired programming language, which I wrote in order to teach myself more about compilers and parsers - very heavily work in progress!

### Still Hungry

A Minecraft mod that adds new foods and cooking mechanics. Features art by [DizzyAlyx](https://dizzyalyx.deviantart.com). Currently unmaintained, but kept online for posterity (it was the first programming project I ever released)!  

## Music
Various pieces of music I've worked on can be found on my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/17cupsofcoffee).
