## Ein
<small>[GitHub](https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee/ein)</small>

A little dynamically-typed programming language, inspired by Rust, Ruby and Wren (among others). I'm writing this as I work my way through [Crafting Interpeters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) - hopefully it'll become a Real Language™ eventually!

## Still Hungry
<small>[Website](https://stillhungry.seventeencups.net/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee/Still-Hungry)</small>

A Minecraft mod that adds new foods and cooking mechanics. Features art by [DizzyAlyx](https://dizzyalyx.deviantart.com). Currently unmaintained, but kept online for posterity (it was the first programming project I ever released)!  

## Music
Various pieces of music I've worked on can be found on my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/17cupsofcoffee).
